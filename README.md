- 👋 Hi, I’m @kevanoullio.
- 👀 I’m interested in digital signal processing, full stack development, strategy analysis & risk management for investing, trading bots, cryptocurrency development, open source development, linux, and specific languages like Python/C/C++/Java and others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front end web development using HTML & CSS, how to code VST audio effects & instruments using Steinberg’s VST SDK & C++, and how to code crypto trading bots using Python/json/webhooks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on VST audio effects & instruments.
- 📫 You can reach me through my website www.vintiquesound.com or on twitter @KevanoUllio.
