- 👋 Hi, I’m @kevanoullio.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Digital Signal Processing, Full Stack Development, Strategy Analysis & Risk Management for investing, trading bots using Python/json/webhooks, cryptocurrency development, open source development, Linux, and specific languages like Python/C/C++/SQL/Java and others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code VST audio effects & instruments using Steinberg’s VST SDK & C++, and will be learning much more about Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Web App development, Java and object oriented programming, and how to code crypto trading bots using Python/json/webhooks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on VST audio effects & instruments.
- 📫 You can reach me through my website www.vintiquesound.com or on twitter @KevanoUllio.
